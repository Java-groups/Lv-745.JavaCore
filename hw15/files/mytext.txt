VAR assumes that its arguments are a sample of the population.
If your data represents the entire population, then compute the variance by using VARP.
Arguments can either be numbers or names, arrays, or references that contain numbers.
Logical values, and text representations of numbers that you type directly into the list of arguments are counted.
If an argument is an array or reference, only numbers in that array or reference are counted.
Empty cells, logical values, text, or error values in the array or reference are ignored.
Arguments var that are error values or text that cannot be translated into numbers cause errors.
If you want to include logical values and text representations of numbers in a reference as part of the calculation, use the VARA function.
